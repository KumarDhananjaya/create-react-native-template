The fastest way to start a new React Native project configured with the **Bare Workflow** and out-of-the-box **web support**.

This command-line tool is designed for developers who want to bypass the interactive prompts and immediately generate a clean, production-ready project structure.

## Why Use This Tool?

The standard `create-expo-app` is fantastic, but it requires you to manually select a template. This tool automates that process for a specific, common use case: starting a project where you know you'll need access to the native `android` and `ios` directories.

## Key Features

-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **One-Command Setup:** Creates a complete project with a single, non-interactive command. No questions asked.
-   üèóÔ∏è **Bare Workflow Ready:** Perfect for projects that require custom native modules or direct access to native project configuration. The `android` and `ios` directories are generated from the start.
-   üåê **Web Support Included:** Automatically installs `react-native-web`, `react-dom`, and other required dependencies so you can run your app in a web browser instantly.
-   ‚ú® **Zero Configuration:** Just run the command and start coding.

## Prerequisites

## Usage

Getting started is as simple as running one command in your terminal. Replace `YourAwesomeApp` with the name of your project.

```bash
npx create-react-native-template YourAwesomeApp
